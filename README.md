# Online-Auctions
Existing Online Auction Platforms may sometimes lack the responsiveness and real-time features that modern users expect.
User interfaces on some platforms can be unintuitive and difficult to navigate for both buyers and sellers.
Concerns regarding the security of payment processing and personal data can deter users from participating fully.
There is a need for a modern platform that offers a responsive, user-friendly, and secure online auction environment.
The platform will utilize React and tailwind for building an interactive and dynamic frontend user interface and Express.js will be employed to create a robust and efficient backend for handling server-side logic.
Sellers will be able to list products with descriptions, images and starting bid prices, while Buyers will be able to browse listings, view product details, and place bids in real-time.
The platform will incorporate secure payment gateway for processing transactions.
Real-time bidding updates will be a core feature, ensuring users are immediately aware of bid changes.
The platform will be designed with scalability in mind to accommodate a growing user base and data volume.
